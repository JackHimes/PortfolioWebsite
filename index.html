						<p><strong>Ingredient Cart</strong> Ingredient Cart is a work-in-progress full stack application that allows users to automatically input items into their pick-up grocery cart (Kroger only, currently) by simply inserting the url of a recipe website. This project is in its early stages. Future directions for this project are to include a machine learning model that can intelligently scrape recipe websites, instead of having to rely on a script. <a target="_blank" href="https://ingredient-cart.vercel.app/">Check it out here!</a></p>

							<li class="icon solid fa-code"><strong>Front End(<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JackHimes/ingredient-cart-frontend">Github Repo</a>):</strong></li>
							<p>The front end is built on nextJS which is leveraging nextUI component library. The front end gets it's data from the back end API. Currently, this repo is deployed on Vercel. Additional features of this front end include having Docker setup for quick local development. Styling is done via Tailwind CSS.</p>
							<li class="icon solid fa-bolt"><strong>Back End(<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JackHimes/ingredient-cart">Github Repo</a>):</strong></li>
							<p>The back end is built with TypeScript, using the TSOA framework to create an API. Features of this back end include token fetching and refreshing middleware, a python script to scrape websites, authentication and encryption and more. This repo is also deployed on Vercel and also has Docker capabilities. </p>

								<p> The programmed death ligand 1 interactome demonstrates bidirectional signaling coordinating immune suppression and cancer progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma</p>

								<p><strong>Description:</strong> In oncology, there is a heuristic tool called the Hall Marks of Cancers. These define certain characteristics that make cells, cancer cells. These include things like continual cell growth and division, metastasis, and resistance of cell death, among others. This publication was focused on more well defining a clinical immunotherapy drug, Keytruda (Pembrolizumab), and it's effects on these hallmarks. These data produced had interesting findings, that will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment plans that will improve patient outcome.</p>

								<p>The Hec1/Ndc80 tail domain is required for force generation at kinetochores, but is dispensable for kinetochoreâ€“microtubule attachment formation and Ska complex recruitment</p>

								<p><strong>Description:</strong> Despite having a large reservoir of biological knowledge, there are still many unknowns about how life works. Research like this publication uncover those mysteries so we can dig deeper into why things are the way they are. The intent of this research was to characterize the amino acid sequence of a specific protein involved in cell division, specifically the cellular machinery that attaches microtubule spindles to the chromosomes during metaphase and anaphase. In short, we found a specific region of the protein that was thought to recruit helper proteins(ska), did not actually have that effect. We also found this region has regulation factors, lastly we found the region that is responsible for ska recruitment. </p>

								<p><strong>Hello, thanks for looking through my website - I'm Jack!</strong> In every job I have pursued, I have always looked for positions that use technology to help people. This is where my passion lays. For as long as I've known, I've been fascinated by technology and it's seemingly limitless potential. I have also developed a strong desire to help and improve the lives of my community and beyond, through my many experiences, work and life. </p>
								<p>When I signed up for my biochemistry degree, I truthfully had no idea what I wanted to do with it, I just knew it had many avenues to achieve my goals. I changed my career path a handful times, testing the waters for each. Initially, I thought research was going to be my career. During this time, I learned much and achieved some proud accomplishments (In this section below). After working in the lab, I began to feel like I was missing a direct contact with the people I was helping, this embarked my career in medicine. Having prepared to go to medical school via my majors concentration, I set eyes for PA school. To achieve this, I first got my EMT-Basic, followed by my IV certification. I worked as an EMT, through Covid, at first in an assisted living home, then at a Trauma II, Stroke and Cardiac Center, Emergency Department. After working for a time in the field and much hard work, I was accepted into PA school, however, admittedly I was a little burned out but had new perspectives; because of this, I sought a career where I can still help people but have a healthier work-life balance. When a co-worker encouraged me to join him in a coding boot-camp, I knew this was my opportunity to do this. I completed the 16 week program, learning much in a short period, and quickly found a full-stack software engineer position at Custom Ink. During my time there, I developed my skills even further, achieving promotion.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/GoodSam.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Through my many work experiences, I have developed a unique and robust skill set. I learned what it meant to work on a team in multiple settings, including what it means to have good communication, how to empower others, and seamlessly collaborate. I also learned how to work under pressure and with delicate situations; whether that be with expensive equipment or high stakes scenarios, I consistently performed. Above all else however, I learned how to learn. This skill has above and beyond taken me further than any other skill. With all of these skills and experiences are put together, I feel prepared to face any new challenge set ahead of me. </p>
								<p> I currently live in Colorado with my amazing wife and dog. I love to do anything outdoors, play soccer, playing board and video games, reading, weight-lift, travel and trying new things. I also totally like to nerd out, so hit me up with whatever you're favorite things are!</p>
